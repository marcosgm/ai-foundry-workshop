A 2025 review led by University of Toronto researchers found that intermittent fasting is just as effective as traditional calorie-restriction diets for weight loss. Various approaches to intermittent fasting, such as alternate-day fasting and time-restricted eating (like a 16:8 schedule), offer similar long-term benefits. Alternate-day fasting may offer slightly better short-term weight loss compared to calorie counting and also improves cardiometabolic markers like blood pressure and cholesterol„Äê3:2‚Ä†medicalxpress.com„Äë.\n",

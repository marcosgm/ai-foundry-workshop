            "\n",
            "3. **Rest and Recovery**: Include at least one full rest day or an active recovery day each week. Active recovery could involve light activities like walking, yoga, or stretching, which aid in muscle repair and prevent burnout.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Progressive Training**: Gradually increase your running distance and intensity over time. Start with shorter runs and slowly build up to longer distances, ensuring you're comfortable and injury-free.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Long Run**: Once a week, include a longer run that is about 30-60% of your 5K distance. This helps build endurance.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Speed Work**: Incorporate one speed workout per week, such as intervals or tempo runs, to improve your pace.\n",

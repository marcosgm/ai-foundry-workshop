      "**Sample Beginner Home Workout:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes)**\n",
      "   - March in place\n",
      "   - Arm circles\n",
      "   - Gentle jumping jacks or stepping side-to-side\n",

      "     Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, squat down as if sitting in a chair, then stand back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Push-Ups (regular or knee):** 5-10 reps  \n",
      "     Modify by doing them on your knees if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Glute Bridges:** 10-15 reps  \n",
      "     Lie on your back, feet flat on the floor, lift your hips towards the ceiling.\n",

      "   - **Wall Sit:** 20-30 seconds  \n",
      "     Slide down a wall as if sitting in a chair, hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Plank:** 20 seconds  \n",
      "     Hold a push-up position on your elbows or hands, keep your body straight.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Standing Shoulder Press (use water bottles or cans):** 10 reps  \n",
      "     Press weights overhead, control on the way down.\n",

      "- Gradually increase repetitions or rounds as you feel comfortable.\n",

      "\n",
      "**3. Resistance Bands:**  \n",
      "These are great for a quick workout. You can do rows, chest presses, biceps curls, and squats‚Äîall with bands.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Mini-Workouts:**  \n",
      "If you can‚Äôt find a 30-minute block, split activity into 2-3 shorter 10-15 minute bursts during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Active Breaks:**  \n",
      "Swap scrolling for sets of lunges or wall sits while on phone calls, or do a plank challenge during TV time.\n",

      "**Tips for busy people:**  \n",
      "- Set a regular exercise ‚Äúappointment,‚Äù even if it‚Äôs just 15 minutes.  \n",
